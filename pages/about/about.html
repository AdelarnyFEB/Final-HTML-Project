    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Adelani Abidemi, born in Ogun state Nigeria.I graduated from the University of Lagos and studied
Biochemistry there, I have always had a passion for tech, which is the reason why am currently learning Web development
 at CapacityBay. I know how to build websites using word press and it has increased my interest in learning the coding aspect of it. I enjoy learning new things and love playing video games and watch football.
I can say I am more of an introvert because I enjoy being alone most of the time.
A big thank you to Capacity bay for this opportunity to learn web development
